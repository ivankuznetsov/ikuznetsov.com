The biggest modern IT myth is maintenance cost of bare metal. People are talking about servers made from metals by engineers as if they're some mythical devices made by ancient wizards. I can imagine some software magic in closed source applications like Oracle databases, but most of the software we use for servers are open source, you can literally read the code.

Magical thinking is a problem of competence. When you don't understand something it feels magical. When you don't want to understand something you will never trust the bare metal server.

Yes indeed modern methods of software deployment put some relief to developers, but mostly because of the complexity created by developers. The more advanced AWS becomes, the more complex tools and architecture developers will choose. Developers are driven by complexity and without understanding of the basic law: entropy can't be reversed, they will put all of their free time available because of the hundred thousand of AWS engineers to create new challenges for them. The more stupidity an instrument tolerates the more stupid the average instrument user will be. Short term gains from simplicity of sophisticated technology providers will be soon covered by advanced distributed map reduce based architecture for your skate shop.

Without physical limitations people lose the sense of reality. There are no magical clouds. There are physical servers managed by engineers. And when you put software to the cloud the only thing you do -- you outsource part of the job to Amazon, Microsoft or other company engineers. I understand many people who are not willing to ever talk to DevOps and ready to pay any money for that, but entropy will fill the gap soon and you will have the same amount of devops engineers as with bare metal servers, because of striving to complexity without physical limitations.
